This folder contains the work for the SMS spam detection system
We use a chat room to mimic SMS communication and filter out any spam messages from reaching other users
To get the model used in the chat app run SMS_spam_detection_BERT to get it

To run the server type python server.py localhost in your ide terminal
In another terminal run python client.py then the address, default is 127.0.0.1
Can add as many clients as you desire, just run the code in another terminal window

Make sure to update any paths within server.py to make sure you are loading in the BERT model
